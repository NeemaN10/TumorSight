# TumorSight

**TumorSight** is an advanced, AI-powered application designed for the early detection of brain tumors through MRI scan analysis. The app provides a streamlined interface to upload, process, and view diagnostic results, enabling healthcare professionals to make fast, reliable assessments.

## Tagline
*"See Beyond the Surface, Detect with Confidence."*

## Features
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Simple and intuitive interface to upload MRI scans and receive instant feedback.
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Leverages deep learning models to classify scans as "Tumor" or "No Tumor" with high accuracy.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Displays the uploaded image alongside diagnostic results to facilitate easy comparison and analysis.
- **Batch Processing**: Option to analyze multiple images in a single session for efficiency.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust model sensitivity and confidence thresholds to suit various diagnostic requirements.

## Installation

1. Clone the TumorSight repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TumorSight.git
Change to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd TumorSight
Install the necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Launch TumorSight:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Upload MRI Scan:

Click the Upload button to select an MRI image for analysis.
The app supports common image formats (JPEG, PNG) and provides an error message for unsupported formats.
View Diagnostic Results:

The app will display the uploaded image with a diagnostic label of either "Tumor" or "No Tumor."
Additional confidence scores are shown, indicating the model’s certainty.
Batch Processing (Optional):

Upload a folder of images to analyze multiple scans in one session. Results will be displayed in a table format, summarizing each scan’s diagnosis and confidence score.
Dataset
The initial version of TumorSight is trained on a public dataset of brain MRI images. The data is organized into "Tumor" and "No Tumor" categories and includes a range of cases to improve model accuracy. Users can further enhance model accuracy by training on larger datasets or fine-tuning the model.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
OpenCV: For image processing and manipulation.
TensorFlow / PyTorch: Machine learning frameworks used for model development.
Tkinter: GUI framework for building the user interface.
Numpy & Pandas: For data handling and processing.
Model Details
TumorSight uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on labeled MRI images. This architecture is optimized to detect features indicative of brain tumors, with adjustments made to minimize false negatives and enhance diagnostic confidence.

Model Settings
Sensitivity: Adjustable sensitivity to prioritize either specificity or recall, depending on the use case.
Confidence Threshold: Set a minimum confidence score for displaying "Tumor" results, helping to reduce misdiagnosis in borderline cases.
